# Downloading
You can download CookieClient at the [releases](https://github.com/bebeli555/CookieClient/releases) tab. And select the latest version and download the `CookieClient-version-release.jar`. Then put the jar file to your mods folder and run minecraft with forge. You can also build it yourself with the instructions below.

# Building
You can build the project and set the development environment by running `gradlew eclipse` and `gradlew genEclipseRuns` then `gradlew build` or in intellij just by running `gradlew genIntellijRuns` then `gradlew build` If you just want to build it without setting up IDE environment then just run `gradlew build` then the built jar will be in build/libs. You need JDK 8 to build it newer versions of java wont work i think.

- Add a good explanation on what your code does and why i should merge it
- Remember to follow the same rules that all the other code does. Which means that dont go putting brackets on their own line as none of the other code does that and name your variables in the same way.
- Dont add too much in one pullrequest. If you for example want to make changes to many modules then make a pullrequest for every module that you changed.
- Code improvements, Performance improvements, and improvements to modules are a great way to contribute.
