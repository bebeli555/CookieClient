- Remember to follow the same rules that all the other code does. Which means that dont go putting brackets on their own line as none of the other code does that and name your variables in the same way.
- Dont add too much in one pullrequest. If you for example want to make changes to many modules then make a pullrequest for every module that you changed.
- Code improvements, Performance improvements, and improvements to modules are a great way to contribute.
